        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Here are some guidelines:\n",
        "- Your battle systems should compare one attribute vs another to determine the likelihood of a hit.\n",
        "- Use dice rolling to add randomness to the system.\n",
        "- A battle should consist of two characters taking turns trying to attack one another. If an attack succeeds it should reduce the Hit Points (or life or whatever attribute). This continues until one of the characters Hit Points reaches zero (in which case, they lose the battle)\n",
        "- Take advantage of the power of numpy and your existing dice roller code from the previous exercises\n",
        " - You should be able to accomplish this just by using arrays and **without using any explicit for loops**\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, a simple system could roll a 20 sided die:\n",
        "- If the roll is 20 its a hit\n",
        "- If the roll is 1 its a fail\n",
        "- If the roll is anything else, `hit = ((Strength + roll) > Defense)` where Strength is the value of the attacking character's strength and Defense is the value of the defending character's defense.   \n",
        "\n",
        "That's just one suggestion, but you can devise your own rules to determine how characters fight. For example you could have both the attacking and defending character roll a dice and do `hit = ((Strength + roll1) > (Defense + roll2))`. It's up to you.\n"

        "4.   Use a Jupyter Notebook. This allows you to interleave \"cells\" of regular text and images (in markdown format) with \"cells\" of python code. To do this, you have to have Jupyter installed on a machine. The actual notebook interface is \"served up\" by that local machine as a web service that you can access through a web browser. If you click the play button next to a \"cell\" of code, it will instruct the server machine to execute that line of code in a shell that is awaiting input and then send the output back to the browser.  Google provides a Jupyter notebook environment that is connected to Google's cloud computing service that you can use for free (with some limitations) through colab.research.google.com. This is what you are using to look at this lecture now. \n",

        "* Python is also loosely typed. This means that the type of a variable is never specified (and in fact can change throughout the course of a program).\n",
        "\n",
        "* Python is typically **interpreted** rather than compiled (though there are implementations that compile). This means that programs are typically executed line by line.\n",
